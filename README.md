Replicating Crossy Road game

Emily Ng and Andrea Wang (Period 2)

We will be replicating the video game “Crossy Road,” where the player controls a chicken and navigates it through roads and rivers. The chicken can die from obstacles, like cars and drowning. It can also die if it fails to keep pace with the moving camera. The objective is to gain as many “points” as possible by staying alive and progressing.
